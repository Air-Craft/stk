The <B>Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)</B> is a set of audio signal processing and synthesis classes and algorithms written in C++.  You can use these classes to create programs that make sounds with a variety of synthesis techniques.  This is not a terribly novel concept, except that the Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it's mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely user-extensible (no libraries, no hidden drivers, and all source code is included).  We like to think that this increases the chances that our programs will still work in another 5-10 years.  In fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously for nearly 8 years now.  STK currently runs with "realtime" support (audio and MIDI) on SGI (Irix), Linux, and Windows computer platforms.  Generic, non-realtime support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should work with any standard C++ compiler.
